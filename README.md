# ⚙️ n8n-workshop

Production-ready n8n workflows and Node.js scripts for building, shaping, and maintaining automation pipelines.

This repository contains workflows I’ve experimented with, tested in real scenarios, refined, and reused.  
Everything here exists because it solved an actual problem, not because it looked cool in a demo.

All workflows are provided as **JSON files**, ready to import directly into the **Annoten UI**.

- Built using **n8n, Node.js, and AI services**  
- Focused on **personal productivity, decision support, and workflow automation**  
- Practical, opinionated, and meant to be reused  

No tutorial scraps. No placeholder flows.

- Failed experiments don’t stay  
- Clarity, failure handling, and reuse matter more than cleverness  

If it can’t survive real usage, it doesn’t belong here.
